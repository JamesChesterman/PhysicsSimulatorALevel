# PhysicsSimulatorALevel
A-Level project that consists of physics simulations that could be used in a teaching setting. Made in early 2020.

This was made for my A-Level project. It was a while ago, so forgive me if some of the code is organised poorly, 
I would like to think that I'm better at Java now.
The project has a few features. One is a physics simulation for something called the photoelectric effect. There
were equations used to translate between the wavelength, frequency and energy of the different particles (the user
would select these), and depending on if these equations met different parameters the simulation would act differently.
I also made it so the wavelength impacted the colour of these particles.
For the second simulation, it's similar to the first one but shows excitation between energy levels. 
Then there is a table which the user can store links to Youtube videos (or other resources) inside. This could be 
useful for keeping track of and useful teaching resources.
There is a database so that each user could store their own Youtube video links. They are also able to store sets
or parameters used for the simulations, just to make the process faster for them (so they could remember what
numbers for the variables did different things).
